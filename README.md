Smart Contract Error Handling
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract named errorhandlingcontract that demonstrates various error handling mechanisms. The contract showcases the usage of require, revert, and assert statements to handle errors and ensure proper contract functionality.

Contract Description
The errorhandlingcontract contract includes the following features:

State Variables:

address public owner: Stores the address of the contract owner with special privileges.
uint256 public value: Holds a numerical value set by the contract owner.
uint256 public constant votingAge = 18: A constant representing the minimum voting age (18).
Constructor:

The constructor sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer (msg.sender).
setValue Function:

Allows the contract owner to set the value variable to a new value.
Includes a require statement to ensure only the contract owner can call this function.
If someone else attempts to call this function, the transaction will revert with the error message "Only the contract owner can set the value."
checkEligibility Function:

A pure function to check if a person with a given age is eligible to vote.
Uses the revert statement to provide eligibility status messages.
If the age provided is less than the voting age (18), the function will revert with the error message "You are not eligible to vote."
If the age is 18 or above, it will revert with the message "You are eligible to vote." (Note: This approach is not typical for real-world scenarios.)
division Function:

A pure function to calculate the division of two numbers (x divided by y) and returns the result.
Includes an assert statement to check if y is not equal to 0.
If y is 0, the assert will cause the transaction to revert without a specific error message.
Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Make sure you have a compatible Solidity compiler installed (e.g., version 0.8.0 or higher).
Use your preferred Solidity development tool to deploy and interact with the smart contract.
Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational purposes only. The error handling mechanisms demonstrated in the contract may not be suitable for all real-world scenarios. For production use, additional considerations and best practices must be followed to ensure robustness and security.
